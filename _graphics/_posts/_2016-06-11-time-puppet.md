# Time Puppet

You need to see the full version of this: that oneâ€™s tall and narrow, so I had to crop it down to present it here. I created this by hand with pencils, then colored everything and touched it up in Photoshop.

## Details:

- Pencil to digital drawing.
- Drawn in about seven hours, maybe.
- Used Photoshop and some pencils.
