# Jing Site

I built this somewhat unusual WordPress website for the Jing restaurant. The client wanted the focus to be the food (thus the full screen backgrounds) with nothing else vying for attention. He also wanted lots of dynamic animation and interactivity.

## Details:

- A somewhat unusual WordPress design.
- Minimalist and focused on the food.
- Lots of dynamic animation and interactivity.
