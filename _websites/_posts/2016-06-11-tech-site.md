# Tech Site

What better way to represent a design degree than to show part of the design process in its website, in this case by simulating design notes penciled on the page? As a team, I designed and built a Dreamweaver template while a grad student gathered and entered the content.

## Details:

- Undergraduate team project.
- Creatively appropriate design.
- Simple Dreamweaver custom template.
