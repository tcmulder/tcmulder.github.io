# Style Site

This was the first tableless website I built, exclusively using CSS for layout. As a teacher’s aide in my undergraduate studies, I wanted to build something a little ahead of its time (these were the CSS Zen Garden days). At least back then, Dreamweaver didn’t CSS design pleasant!

## Details:

- My first tableless CSS design.
- Advanced website design course project.
- Painfully developed in Dreamweaver MX 2004.
