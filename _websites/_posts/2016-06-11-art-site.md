# Art Site

The art isnâ€™t really the point. Look under the hood: one valid XHTML Strict page controlled by Ajax to seem like thirty-nine pages. It makes for an efficient use of bandwidth, and the interactivity is fun.

## Details:

- Everything lovingly hand-coded.
- XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Some Ajax, XML, and PHP too.
