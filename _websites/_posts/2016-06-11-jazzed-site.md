# Jazzed Site

My first Flash website, created on my own while in college, advanced my skills to where I was able to become a Teacher’s Aide in my advanced web course while enrolled in it. Flash has a steep learning curve without assistance, but the climb was exhilarating; kind of like rock climbing without an rope.

## Details:

- First Flash website.
- ActionScript and Fireworks.
- Qualified me as Teacher’s Aide.
