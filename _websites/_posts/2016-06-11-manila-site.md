# Manila Site

After several tightly controlled portfolio designs, I decided to create something more flexible that I could add content and links to easily. The mix of external CSS, jQuery, and PHP made modification a snap. The sliding resume also added functionality and flair.

## Details:

- Hand-coded: no Dreamweaver.
- XHTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP.
- Unique resume animation.
