# Magni Site

After developing a magnetic-looking ActionScript effect, I decided to design a website incorporating the effect in a unique way on each page. The interaction would be somewhat extreme for other applications, but I designed this website to play more like a game than a traditional website.

## Details:

- ActionScript development.
- "Magnetic" simulation effects.
- Uniquely interactive interface.
