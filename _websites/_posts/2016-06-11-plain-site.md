# Plain Site

This is the first online portfolio that I built and published. I taught myself to design using tables (I know, I’m now ashamed) under some pretty intensive time constrains, allowing me to become a Teacher’s Aide in my college web 101 course while enrolled in it.

## Details:

- My first online portfolio.
- Self-learned table design.
- 40+ pages of HTML exploration.
