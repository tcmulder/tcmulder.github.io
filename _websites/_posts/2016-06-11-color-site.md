# Color Site

I decided to push the capabilities of Webkit and CSS3 to see what these cutting-edge design technologies could accomplish. The result is unique and engaging, though only compatible of course with a Webkit browser.

## Details:

- Webkit experimentation dump.
- XHTML, CSS3, Ajax, and jQuery.
- Requires a Webkit browser.
