# Port Site

This website showcased my portfolio in a virtual brochure, matching the style of my physical portfolio at the time. I designed it in Dreamweaver, then rewrote it as XHTML. Itâ€™s high-end, and a bit of a bandwidth hog.

## Details:

- Designed in Dreamweaver.
- Rewritten for validity.
- High-bandwidth recommended.
