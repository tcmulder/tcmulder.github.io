# Duport Site

This design was the precursor to the current portfolio website you are viewing. It used a lot of jQuery to liven up interactivity, but worked well also with JavaScript turned off. Great progressive enhancement!

## Details:

- Hand-coded, mostly in Komodo.
- XHTML Strict, CSS, jQuery, and PHP.
- Progressive technological enhancement.
