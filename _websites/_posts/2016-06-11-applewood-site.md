# Applewood Site

I built this for a small farm in New York as part of a graduate school assignment. It worked out well for everyone: my clients got a free site, and I got an A+. See the live site at applewoodacres.net, or click on the image for my hosted sample version.

## Details:

- Backed by the power of WordPress.
- Built to demonstrate well formed jQuery.
- Designed the logo and icons, too.
